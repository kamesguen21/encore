## Encore.js
============

This is an MVC framework for node.js that I'm building. I've authored 3 modules specifically for this project:  
* Runway - my router
* FileFetcher - project file loader
* Easyioc - inversion of control module

Here are the features that I have working currently:  

* Inversion of control dependency loading  
* Route Groups  
* Route Filters  
* Route Arguments  
* RESTful Controllers  
* Filters on controllers  
* View templating (any 3rd party templating library)  
* Non-blocking view rendering  
* Simple recursive project loading

More coming soon.
